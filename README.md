<img src="/KaomojiPicker.png" width="392">


## Features

- Quickly insert kaomoji
- Customizable list of kaomoji
- Available in Danish and English


## Usage

- Move _Kaomoji Picker.app_ to your Applications folder
- Launch it, and optionally add it to launch on login
- Grant accessibility access through System Settings (needed to insert text in other apps)
- Press Control-Option-Command-Space to show Kaomoji Picker


### Usage with Discord

For some reason, Discord seemingly doesn’t respond to accessibility queries by default.

Until a proper solution is found, a temporary workaround is launching Accessibility Inspector and inspecting any element in Discord. Kaomoji Picker will now work until the next time you launch Discord.
